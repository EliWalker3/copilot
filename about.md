# Reflection with Copilot

<p class="mb-6"> Copilot was actually very helpful for this assignment. This was my first time using AI directly with my code and it blew my expectations out of the water. In the past, I've used AI to find issues in my personal projects, but it was more of a back and forth interaction rather than the tool being in the same environment.</p>

<p class="mb-6"> When comparing the two models I used (GPT 4o & Claude 3.5), Claude was the much better tool for this environment. There were a few instances with Chat GPT that led me down paths that broke my code entirely. For example, when I added the APIs and the script needed to run it, everything besides the API content loaded. When I showed my code to GPT and asked why it wasn't running, it responded with</p> 

<p class="mb-6">"It looks like the issue might be with the fetching functions (fetchPosts() and fetchProducts()) not being defined in your scripts/script.js file. Letâ€™s debug and fix it step by step."</p>

<p class="mb-6">At this point, I had the correct format of my fetching function. It was also at this point where I switched to Claude. I asked Claude if anything was wrong with myy script file and that the content wasn't loading properly. Claude managed to show me everything that could be fixed in my code and implemented error checks in my scripts file. Claude also gives a recap of everything that was changed and responded with</p>

<p class="mb-6">"The main difference from your previous approach is that we're now using a single x-data directive at the top level instead of separate ones for each section, which is more efficient and easier to manage."</p>

<p class="mb-6">Overall, I think I will only dabble in copilot mainly because high use of it can take away from your project. It's very helpful when I'm stuck but it would be hard to get creative if I relied on it.</p>
